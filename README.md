# Description
Each group was assigned a topic, together with an example website you need to crawl your data from.
You needto build a system that gathers a large collection of samples associated with the topicand enable the search over this collection. 
To build the collections, you need to crawl multiple sources(websites), similar in content and topic to the website suggested.

The system mustprovide an interface for searching, browsing, and presentation ofthe data to the user.The system  should also  have two  additional  features.  

Additional  features are  categorized into two groups: complex and simple features. 

# Simple Features
- Results presentation: results should be presented in a tabular format, so that many results could be seen at the same time. Each table cell should contain appropriate information for your project.
- Filtering:  in  addition  to  being  able  to  search  by  title,  an  user  should  be  able  to  filter  the results based on at least 3 relevant attributes for your project.
- Results Snippets: present result snippets of each retrieved result (maximum 2-3 lines) in a kind of “Google style”, with query terms highlighted.

# Complex Features
- Automatic Recommendation: In addition to the relevant search results pertaining to the user query, the user should also be suggested “similar” products based on, say, category, description,  price  etc.  The  ordering  among  the  recommended  items  is  not  important.
- User  Relevance  Feedback: after  presenting  the  search  results  to  a  user,  the  user  may provide a positive or negative feedback on the results
- Results  clustering:  the  system  should  group  results  into  topics.
